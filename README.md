Nyanology: having fun with edje and Terminology
==========

A nyan cat in your term ? That's possible now !


How to use ?
--------

Make sure you have terminology and edje (edje_cc) installed. It's on E's svn.

Run `make play`.

You're done.


How does it look ?
--------

What's missing ? (TODO)
--------
 - proper selection. Current one might be fun, but isn't usable
 - stop hacking Terminology's about box, and add our own
 - optional nyan music for the mood
